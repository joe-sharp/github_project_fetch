# Vercel Configuration for GitHub Actions

## 🚫 Disable Automatic Deployments

To ensure your GitHub Actions workflows have full control over deployments and testing, you should disable Vercel's automatic deployments.

### Option 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your project in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Git**
3. Under **Deploy Hooks**, disable:
   - ❌ **Automatic deployments from Git pushes**
   - ❌ **Automatic deployments from Git pull requests**

### Option 2: Via vercel.json Configuration

Add this to your `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": false,
      "*": false
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Alternative: Ignore Specific Branches

If you want to keep some automatic deployments but control specific branches:

```json
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": false,
      "develop": true
    }
  }
}
```

## ⚡ Benefits of Using GitHub Actions Instead

- **Pre-deployment checks**: Rubocop and RSpec run before any deployment
- **Consistent testing**: Same test suite runs for both preview and production
- **Better error handling**: Failed tests prevent bad deployments
- **Audit trail**: All deployments are tracked in GitHub Actions
- **Conditional deployments**: Only deploy if all checks pass

## 🔄 Migration Steps

1. **Disable Vercel auto-deployments** (using method above)
2. **Test the GitHub Actions workflows**:
   - Create a test PR to verify the PR workflow
   - Merge to main to verify the production workflow
3. **Monitor the first few deployments** to ensure everything works correctly

## 🚨 Important Notes

- Disabling auto-deployments means **only** GitHub Actions will deploy your app
- Make sure your GitHub secrets are correctly configured before disabling
- You can always re-enable auto-deployments if needed
- Consider testing with a non-production project first
